# Welcome to our SData 2.0 file repository

This repository contains technical information defining the SData version 2.0 standard. The contents are to be viewed as extensions and amendments to the current [version 1.1](http://interop.sage.com/daisy/sdata/Introduction.html) of the standard.

The documents below form the technical core of  SData 2.0 (click on the links to download directly):

* [Approach](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202.0%20approach%20-%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true): The SData 2.0 approach document presents a number of key statements and goals that guide the current development of the standard

* [Contracts](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202.0%20-%20contracts%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true): The Contracts document describes the concept of an SData contract, an area not clearly presented in the current version of the standard. It shows the role of contracts, describes the many shapes they may take and finishes by outlining some items that could be considered by contract designers.

* [Core](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202.0%20Core%20-%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true): The Core document outlines the essential components of SData 2.0 and describes the differences to the 1.1 version of the standard.


* [JSON Formatted responses](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/JSON%20formatted%20SData%20responses%20-%20v101.pdf?raw=true): The document describes the various aspects relating to the integration of JSON in SData. It covers the response JSON formatting as well as the mechanisms used to request JSON from a provider.


* [Expressing metadata in JSON](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202%200%20Expressing%20metadata%20in%20JSON%20-%20v1.pdf?raw=true): The document describes how metadata surfaces in SData JSON responses. It defines the set of SData-recognized structural elements such as types and links as well as the manner in which metadata surfaces in SData JSON responses. The document also introduces prototypes, the JSON parallel to schemas.


* [SageID integration](https://github.com/Sage/SData-2.0/blob/master/SData%202%200%20Sage%20ID%20Integration.pdf?raw=true): defines how SData 2.0 compliant providers interact with the SageID authentication provider.
