* [Approach](https://github.com/tudor06/TudorTestRepository/blob/master/doc/SData%202.0%20approach%20-%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true): The SData 2.0 approach document presents a number of key statements and goals that guide the current development of the standard

* [Contracts](https://github.com/tudor06/TudorTestRepository/blob/master/doc/SData%202.0%20-%20contracts%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true): The Contracts document describes the concept of an SData contract, an area not clearly presented in the current version of the standard. It shows the role of contracts, describes the many shapes they may take and finishes by outlining some items that could be considered by contract developers.

* [Core](https://github.com/tudor06/TudorTestRepository/blob/master/doc/SData%202.0%20Core%20-%20v%20101.pdf?raw=true): SData 2.0 is a web toolkit allowing for a flexible, purpose-directed usage. Based on the existing SData 1.1 elements, the 2.0 version is organized as a small set of essentials (the Core) complemented by a wide variety of optional mechanisms and techniques that are solution orientated. In broad strokes, the core is quickly described:
    * compliance with HTTP rules and definitions 
    * adherence to one of the SData supported formats, ATOM or JSON


* [JSON Formatted responses](https://github.com/tudor06/TudorTestRepository/blob/master/doc/JSON%20formatted%20SData%20responses%20-%20v101.pdf?raw=true): JSON is the principal format used by web and mobile clients to manage and request information; it is by nature is less verbose than xml and intrinsically simple. These reasons, coupled with the need to increase SData’s relevance in the web/mobile segment, have prompted the inclusion of JSON into the standard on an equal footing with the ATOM specification.
The attached document describes the JSON format for SData information exchanges.
