title: 10.1 Delete Example
---

A resource is deleted by sending a <tt>DELETE</tt> request on its URL. For
example:

<pre class="http">DELETE /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/salesOrders('43661')
If-Match: STFtZgHEkPz7TyH98YEmWA==</pre>

If the operation succeeds, the service provider sends the following response:

<pre class="http">200 OK</pre>

The delete operation doesn't send the Atom entry, the URL is sufficient.
Similarly, a successful response doesn't return any Atom entry.

Some HTTP infrastructures do not support the <tt>DELETE</tt> method. In such
cases, the request SHOULD be submitted as a <tt>POST</tt> with an
additional&nbsp;<tt>X-HTTP-Method-Override</tt> header set to <tt>DELETE</tt>. The
request becomes:

<pre class="http">POST /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/salesOrders('43661')
X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE
If-Match: STFtZgHEkPz7TyH98YEmWA==</pre>

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MUST support delete operations on all resource
kinds that have the <tt>sme:canDelete</tt> flag set to true.

SData providers SHOULD support <tt>POST</tt> with the
<tt>X-HTTP-Method-Override</tt> header as an alternative to the <tt>DELETE</tt>
method.</blockquote>
