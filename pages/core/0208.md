title: 2.8  System and Registry URL
---

SData reserves the following URLs for “system” resources and services:

<pre class="coffeescript">http://www.example.com/sdata/$system
http://www.example.com/sdata/$system/registry</pre>

The <tt>$system</tt> segment name is reserved by SData. At this stage, SData
only defines the <tt>registy</tt> segment below it, for the registry service.
See [SData Registry](../1400/ "14 SData Registry") section for details.

Other system services similar to the registry may be introduced in the
future. They will all be rooted at the <tt>$system</tt> URL. The $system URL
space is reserved for standard SData services. Applications should not introduce
non standard segments under <tt>$system</tt>, unless they prefix them with an
underscore. See [Extensibility](../0215/ "2.15 Extensibility") section.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers MAY support the <tt>$system</tt> URL and
implement the registry contract. If they do so, their <tt>$system</tt> URL MUST
be under the <tt>/sdata</tt> virtual directory.</blockquote>
