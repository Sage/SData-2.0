Feed level links are followed by one or more categories:

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;category scheme="http://schemas.sage.com/sdata/categories" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; term="collection" label="Resource Collection"/&gt;</pre>

In this example, the feed carries only one category element. This category
element classifies the feed as being an SData resource collection - a
<tt>collection</tt> in the SData scheme. See [SData Scheme](../0312/ "3.12 SData Category Scheme") section for details.

Providers can&nbsp;add more categories to the feeds&nbsp;they produce. But they should
never have more than one category in the SData scheme, identified by the
<tt>http://schemas.sage.com/sdata/categories</tt> URL.

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers SHOULD include this category element in their feeds</blockquote>
