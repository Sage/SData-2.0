title: "2.1  Resource Collection URL"
---

Let's start with a typical SData URL for a resource collection:

<pre>http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/prod/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10</pre>

This URL has the following components:

<table class="content">

IP address is also allowed (<tt>192.168.1.1</tt>).

Can be followed by port number. For example
<a href="http://www.example.com:5493">www.example.com:5493</a>)

5493 is the recommended port number for SData services that are not exposed
on the Internet.

An SData service can support several “integration contracts” side-by-side.
For example, a typical Sage ERP service will support a <tt>crmErp</tt> contract
which exposes the resources required by CRM integration (with schemas imposed by
the CRM/ERP contract) and a <tt>native</tt> or <tt>default</tt> contract which
exposes all the resources of the ERP in their native format.

Dataset

</td>
<td>

Identifies the dataset when the application gives access to several datasets,
such as several companies and&nbsp;production/test datasets.

If the application can only handle a single dataset, or if it can be
configured with a default dataset, a hyphen can be used as a placeholder for the
default dataset. For example, if prod is the default dataset in the example
above, the URL could be shortened as:

<tt><a href="http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10">http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/accounts?startIndex=21&amp;count=10</a></tt>

If several parameters are required to specify the dataset (for example
database name and company id), they should be formatted as a single&nbsp;segment in
the URL. For example, <tt>myApp/myContract/demodb;acme/accounts</tt> -- the
semicolon separator is application specific, not imposed by SData.

Resource Kind

</td>
<td>

This URL segment identifies the kind of resource that is&nbsp;queried
(<tt>account</tt>, <tt>contact</tt>, <tt>salesOrder</tt>, etc.)

This URL returns the collection of all account resources, as an Atom feed.

If the contract exposes a large number of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/core/0101/" title="1.1 Terminology">resources
kinds</a>, a functional group can be inserted before the resource kind
segment&nbsp;(eventually a hierarchy of functional groups), which&nbsp;act as a folder (a
hierarchy of folders) to organize the resources.

Typical functional groups would be <tt>financials</tt>,
<tt>commercials</tt>, <tt>HR</tt>, etc.

Query parameters

The <tt>startIndex</tt> and <tt>count</tt> parameters allow the service
consumer to request a specific page in a collection. See
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/core/0604/" title="6.4 Query Paging">paging section</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/pages/core/0211/" title="2.11  Query Parameters">query

<blockquote class="compliance">SData URLs MUST comply with this structure. The components
listed in the table above MUST be present, unless the URL is an intermediate URL
(see <a href="../0209/" title="2.9 Intermediate URLs">Intermediate URLs</a> section) and they MUST be in
the right order. There is nevertheless a tolerance on the <tt>/sdata</tt>
virtual directory component. Applications MAY use a different virtual directory
name or MAY have more than one segment before the application name if their
deployment infrastructure requires it. Such applications SHOULD NOT expose a
$system URL (see <a href="../0208/" title="2.8  System and Registry URL">System and Registry URL</a> section) as
the <tt>$system</tt> component MUST be in the <tt>/sdata</tt> virtual directory.</blockquote>
