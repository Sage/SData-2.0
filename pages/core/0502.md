SData&nbsp;relies on the standard&nbsp;HTTP authentication protocol for authentication.

This protocol is described in
[RFC 2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt). Two modes are
available:

*   [Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication):
The password is passed in base 64 encoding, which is no safer than clear text.
This option should only be used in conjunction with HTTPS.
*   [Digest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication):
The password is passed as a hash. Use this option&nbsp;when the&nbsp;communication is not
encrypted.

The basic mode is actually quite simple: the user name and password are
combined as user:password. This string is then encoded in base 64 and passed to
the provider through the HTTP authorization header, as the following example
demonstrates:

<pre>GET /sdata/myApp/myContract/-/customers HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==</pre>

The server decodes the <tt>Authorization</tt> header, extracts the user name
and password and sets the authorization accordingly. If the user name or
password is invalid, the server responds with a <tt>401 Unauthorized</tt>
response.

The digest mode is more complex. A good description can be found in the
[wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication).

HTTP&nbsp;authentication is built into the standard HTTP infrastructure.&nbsp;Unless
they implement the HTTP layer themselves, teams that implement SData providers
or consumers don't need to worry about the low level protocol details. They just
need to know the API&nbsp;to pass the credentials if they implement the consumer
side, and the API to verify them&nbsp;if they implement&nbsp;the producer side.

For example, a javascript consumer based on the <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt>
component can pass the credentials with a call like:

<pre>xmlhttp.open("GET", "http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/myContract/-/customers", false, "admin", "sesame");</pre>

<blockquote class="note">The consumer side doesn't need to worry about whether the
provider requires basic or digest authentication. The HTTP protocol incorporates
an exchange of information&nbsp;so that&nbsp;the consumer component&nbsp;selects the correct
authentication mode. Components such as <tt>XMLHttpRequest</tt> do this
automatically.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="compliance">SData providers SHOULD use HTTP authentication, digest or basic,
unless they use a more secure protocol like Sage SSO. HTTP basic SHOULD NOT be
used over the internet, unless the communication is secured by HTTPS.</blockquote>
