title: Requesting metadata

Provision of metadata is OPTIONAL for SData Providers.  If a Provider does support metadata, it MAY 
choose to provide consumers with metadata by default.

A consumer can specifically request metadata-enhanced responses through URL parameters as shown 
below:

<pre>
 GET http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/-/-/products?**includeMetadata**=true 
 GET http://www.example.com/sdata/myApp/-/-/products?**includePrototype**=true 
</pre>

In both examples, the response will be supplemented with metadata. In the second case, the metadata 
will take the form of an embedded $prototype object as explained in more detail in [SData prototypes](../05-1000/) section.

The "include" parameters provide an efficient[&sup2;](#2) manner for consumers to retrieve metadata.

In the case of prototypes, these may also be directly retrieved from links specified by the Provider, for 
example:

<pre> GET http://www.example.com/sdata/MyApp/-/-/$prototypes/addresses('detail')</pre>

The prototypes of an application are resources exposed under a $prototypes URL segment.  While the 
complete URL delivering prototypes is a matter for the application, it is suggested that the $prototypes
be located at the same level as resource kinds.

As discussed in [SData prototypes](../05-1000/) section, a resource kind may expose several prototypes.  These are returned as a JSON 
feed by a GET operation on the URL ending in $prototypes/*resourceKindName*.

For example, the following will retrieve a feed of $prototypes for the addresses resource kind:   

<pre> GET http://www.example.com/sdata/MyApp/-/-/$prototypes/addresses</pre>

***
<a name="2" href="#2">2</a>. In this manner an additional round-trip to retrieve the prototype separately is avoided.
