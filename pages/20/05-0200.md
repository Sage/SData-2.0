title: Required attributes of the JSON metadata representation
---

Practical experience applying SData, along with feedback from teams using JSON, clearly demonstrates 
that the capabilities of SData v2.0 for expressing metadata should possess at least the following
attributes:

*  Support for JSON as a first-class representation (i.e., no requirement for XML or Atom support 
when using JSON as the metadata representation).
*  Available at the resource and property level.
*  Retrievable:
    *  alongside a regular feed (similar to the includeSchema URL parameter in SData v1.1).
    *  from a predefined location (similar to the $schema URL segment in SData v1.1).
*  Support of the relevant metadata elements defined in the SData v1.1 specification.
*  Standards-based where appropriate.
*  As concise and unobtrusive as possible. 
*  Human and machine readable.
*  Suitable for validation and automated testing as well as the main use case of enabling smart clients to respond to metadata.
