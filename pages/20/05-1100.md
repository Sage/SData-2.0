<blockquote class="compliance"> 

<p>A provider SHOULD consider metadata support in its payloads. This has the advantage of supporting for 
more dynamic/flexible clients that usually rely on metadata to interact with users. However, if the 
particular use case does not require metadata and its support would burden the development effort, a 
provider need not implement it.</p>

<p>If metadata is supported, the provider MAY choose to support <a href="../05-1000/" title="10 SData prototypes">SData prototypes</a> but MUST support <a href="../05-0400/" title="4 Requesting metadata"> embedded metadata</a>. </p>

<p>If a prototype for the targeted resource exists, the provider MUST return it in the payload for a GET 
request with the '?includePrototype=true' specification; if no prototype exists, the specification has 
no effect.</p>

<p>The amount of metadata returned is a provider specific decision. A reasonable expectation is that, if 
prototypes are supported, the embedded metadata would consist only of overrides to the prototype.</p>

<p>A consumer MAY leverage the metadata existent in a response. If it does so then, <u>unless otherwise 
specified in the underlying contract</u>:</p>
<p>
- If a prototype exists, then this MUST be retrieved and the <a href="../05-1000/" title="10.4 Merge process"> merge process</a> MUST be applied.</p>
<p>-  The <a href="../05-0600/" title="6 Substitution formalism"> substitution process</a> MUST be applied.</p>
