title: 2.4 Digest Variant
---

Usually we synchronize whole collections of resources rather than
individual&nbsp;resources. So, SData uses a variant of the vector clock algorithm in
which the nodes track the vector clocks at the collection level rather than at
the resource level.

At the resource level, the SData algorithm only tracks the last modification:
a single (Ni, Ti, Si) triplet where Ni is the node where the resource was last
modified, Ti the tick at that node when the modification was detected and Si
the&nbsp;modification timestamp (to solve conflicts when priorities are equal). This
is less expensive and easier to implement because the synchronization metadata
can be stored in a syncdata table with a simple&nbsp;one&nbsp;to&nbsp;one join to the resource
table.

The&nbsp;collection level vector clock is called “digest” in the SData
terminology. The SData digest is actually an “extended” vector clock made of
triplets (node id, tick, conflict priority).

The following diagram shows how the sync metadata is organized at the
collection and resource level:

This variant of the vector clock algorithm assumes that synchronization is
performed one collection at a time rather than one resource at a time (although
it can also be used to propagate changes on individual resources, under certain
conditions).

The digest of a node can also be interpreted as a “summary” of the vector
clocks of all the resources of the&nbsp;collection at that node. For example, if the
digest for a collection is (N1 6 1)(N2 7 2)(N3 9 3) at node N1, this means that
N1’s collection has been synchronized with N2’s&nbsp;collection at tick 7 (N1's state
takes into account all changes made on N2 with tick &lt; 7) and with N3’s
collection&nbsp;at tick 9 (N1's state takes into account all changes made on N3 with
tick &lt; 9)

Synchronization now relies on the following principles:

1.  A collection may have different digests at different nodes. The goal of the
synchronization system is to bring the collections in sync across nodes. When a
collection is fully synchronized, its digest is the same on all nodes.

1.  By comparing the digests of a given collection on two nodes, the
synchronization algorithm can select the resources that need to be synchronized
in both directions (see&nbsp;[Change Selection with Digest](../0205/ "2.5 Selecting Changes with Digest")).

1.  The algorithm does not have complete vector clocks at the resource level but
it has four pieces of information at hand when it synchronizes a resource: the
two digests + the two resource level triplets. This is sufficient to detect and
resolve conflicts (see&nbsp;[Conflict&nbsp;Handling with Digest](../0206/ "2.6 Handling Conflicts with Digest")).
